## Successes and Challenges 
A challenge I faced in this project is trying to connect to the static files. You have to make sure that you have the right file path or else your API's won't work properly. 
A success I faced was to quickly identify my problem in my post api/notes code, trying different functions to get the correct answers. There are so many ways you can feel confident code and then it not deliver so I was proud that I was able to nip it in the bud. I would like to thank Rommel, Ringo and Neil for providing me with the education that helped me understand this assignment.

## Future Development
I would like to see maybe a drawing tool feature added to this. That will be something I would like to challenge myself with, I welcome anyone who wants to contribute.
